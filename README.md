## Citybiker's Pinboard - client (Android) side

This project is a client for an application created for the OpenAPIHackathon - CityBiker's Pinboard.

The idea is to make it somehow holo-friendly, but rather use premade (thx Google!) components.

Contains mockups (Balsamiq) + the rest of what is necessary.

The communication will be probably based on https://github.com/octo-online/robospice.

Uses RoboElectric for Android testing. The test project is stored in citybiker-android-test/ directory. Please go there and read README.md file for details on how to use RoboElectric here.

Current state of mockups can be viewed somehere here (in docs directory): https://github.com/siemionides/citybiker-android/blob/master/docs/all_mockups.pdf

Enjoy!
