## Citybiker's Pinboard - client (Android) side

This project is a client for an application created for the OpenAPIHackathon - CityBiker's Pinboard.

The idea is to make it somehow holo-friendly, but rather use premade (thx Google!) components.

Contains mockups (Balsamiq) + the rest of what is necessary.

The communication will be probably based on https://github.com/octo-online/robospice.

Enjoy!
