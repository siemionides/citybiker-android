# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# For RoboSpice
#Results classes that only extend a generic should be preserved as they will be pruned by Proguard 
#as they are "empty", others are kept
-keep class pl.citybikerandroid.domain.**

#RoboSpice requests should be preserved in most cases
-keepclassmembers class pl.citybiker.network.** {
  public void set*(***);
  public *** get*();
  public *** is*();
}

#if you use public fields instead of setter/getters for your REST POJOs, add this
-keepclassmembers class pl.citybikerandroid.domain.** {
      public <fields>;
}

### Jackson SERIALIZER SETTINGS
-keepclassmembers,allowobfuscation class * {
    @org.codehaus.jackson.annotate.* <fields>;
    @org.codehaus.jackson.annotate.* <init>(...);
}
